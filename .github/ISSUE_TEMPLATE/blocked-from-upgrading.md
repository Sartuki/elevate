STOP: We cannot provide support on individual server issues. cPanel Technical Support is ready to help! Please contact [cPanel Technical Support](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/how-to-open-a-technical-support-ticket/) if you encounter problems.

Be sure to review the [documentation on what you should do before upgrading](https://cpanel.github.io/elevate/#before-updating).

If you are getting a message that you cannot upgrade from 7 to 8 due to installed software, this is a limitation of `elevate-cpanel`. We are working hard to automate support for many of these problems but we may not yet have gotten to your particular blocker. Information may also exist on how you can overcome this blocker in our [blocker documentation](https://cpanel.github.io/elevate/blockers/).

If the above issues are your situation, please do not open a ticket here. We cannot help you!
